# Flight tracker

Track your aircraft in [X-Plane 11](https://www.x-plane.com/) with [ExtPlane(JS)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/extplanejs)!

# Setup

Install the ExtPlane plugin to X-Plane and set your simulator's IP address in `index.js`. Run with Docker if you want to, and be sure to expose port `80`. If you choose not to run with docker, run `npm start`.

# WebSockets and a proper GUI

I will maybe add a web GUI in the future. Be sure to let me know if you have any suggestions.
